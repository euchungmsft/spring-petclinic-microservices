# Fully managed load-testing for PetClinic app

This example shows how to config managed load testing for PetClinic by using Azure load Testing. It enables developers and testers to generate high-scale load and run simulations that reveal actionable insights into app performance, scalability, and capacity with a fully managed load-testing service. Get started quickly using existing Apache JMeter scripts, gain specialized recommendations backed by comprehensive metrics and analytics, and support continuous improvement through automated continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows—all with a testing service built for Azure.

There you need to install [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi) first, latest version's recommended

1. Config test by using JMeter
2. Deploy the test to Azure Load Testing
3. Run & Evaluating the test

## 1. Config test by using JMeter

Open `tests/petclinic-test-all.jmx` from JMeter

In the test plan, there you can find three Thread Groups on the left. 

- `user-scenario-01` is scenario test navigating pages on PetClinic app which you may want to run for load testing. It only contains simply calling page in GET method in this example, but you can add cookies, custom headers, authentications and so on upon your needs.

- `api-testing-01` is for API test. API test's configured for 4 apis. It's for synthetic monitoring in operation for the APIs

- `api-monitoring-01` is for monitoring which calls actuator end-points instrumented in the app

What's Synthetic Monitoring ? It enables to identify problems and determine if a website or application is slow or experiencing downtime before that problem affects actual end-users or customers. This type of monitoring does not require actual traffic, thus the name synthetic, so it enables you to test applications 24x7, or test new applications prior to a live customer-facing launch to help provide visibility on application health during off peak hours when transaction volume is low. When combined with monitoring tools, synthetic monitoring can provide deeper visibility into end-to-end performance, regardless of where applications are running. 

Because synthetic monitoring is a simulation of typical user behavior or navigation through a website, it is often best used to monitor commonly trafficked paths and critical business processes. Synthetic tests must be scripted in advance, so it is not feasible to measure performance for every permutation of a navigational path an end-user might take. This is more suited for passive monitoring.

What's Spring Boot actuator ? Monitoring the Spring Boot app, gathering metrics, understanding traffic, or the state of our database become trivial with this dependency. The main benefit of Actuator is that you can get production-grade tools without having to actually implement these features yourself. 
Actuator is mainly used to expose operational information about the running application — health, metrics, info, dump, env, etc. It uses HTTP endpoints or JMX beans to enable us to interact with it.
Once this dependency is on the classpath, several endpoints are available for us out of the box. As with most Spring modules, we can easily configure or extend it in many ways.
